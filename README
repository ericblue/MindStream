# Project: Neurosky Mindstream - System tray app to stream EEG data 

[Overview]

Mindstream is a simple java-based system tray app that streams EEG brainwave data from NeuroSky 
devices (MindWave,MindSet).  The app interfaces to NeuroSky devices using the ThinkGear Socket 
protocol (connecting on localhost:13854), retrieves data in JSON Format, and can "stream" to 
other applications.  Mindstream can save the following data:

	* Focus levels 
		- attention
		- meditation
	* EEG values
		- delta
		- theta
		- lowAlpha
		- highAlpha
		- lowBeta
		- highBeta
		- lowGamma
		- highGamma
	* Headset signal strength
		- poorSignalLevel
		

Streaming functions will include:

    * [Currently Implemented] Saving EEG data to a CSV File 
    * [TBD] Listen on a socket and replay data from localhost:13854 
    	- allowing other applications to connect
    * [TBD] Broadcast to a URL - supporting POST/M-POST and streaming real-time data
    	- future use? Processing Javascript version of the Neurosky BrainWave Visualizer

[Installation]

Currently there is no installer.  You can download the source and/or binary distribution:
the primary executable (mindstream.jar) is located in the dist directory.  There are 
helper scripts to execute loading the app (mindstream.sh for Linux/Mac and mindstream.bat
for Windows).  Both scripts simply execute ( java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib -jar dist/mindstream.jar).
    		
    		
[Current Status]

- Alpha state
- Streaming only supports writing to a CSV file
- Tested on Linux and Windows with Java 1.6 and the MindWave headset
